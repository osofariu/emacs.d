# emacs

Hope to make emacs config more portable between machines.  This is the beginning
of sharing my configuration using Github.

My goal is, having emacs installed on a machine - to be able to clone this in
~/.emacs.d and be ready to go.  I shouldn't have to make too many customizations
for same OS.

## Notes
- Using OSX distribution from : - Using http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs
  It's based on the vanilla distribution, but it has some additional
  packages.. and it's quite up-to-date.
